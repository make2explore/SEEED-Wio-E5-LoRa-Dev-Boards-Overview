**Wio-E5** is a low-cost, ultra-low power, extremely compact, and high-performance **LoRaWAN®** Module designed by **Seeed Technology Co., Ltd.** It contains ST system-level package chip STM32WLE5JC, which is the ***world first SoC integrated with the combo of LoRa® RF and MCU chip.***  

**Wio-E5 Development Kit** is a compact development toolset for you to unlock the powerful performance of the Wio-E5 STM32WLE5JC. Wio-E5 Dev Board embedded with Wio-E5 STM32WLE5JC Module that supports LoRaWAN® protocol on global frequency band. It leads out full GPIOs of Wio-E5 supporting various data protocols and interfaces including RS-485, Grove, male/female headers, etc. It would be a perfect choice for fast testing and rapid prototyping of your LoRa® IoT projects.  

**Wio-E5 mini** is a compacted-sized development board suitable for the rapid testing and building of small-size prototyping and helps you design your ideal LoRaWAN® wireless IoT device with a long-distance transmission range.  

These LoRa Decelopment Boards are manufactured by **Seeed Technology Co., Ltd.** Which is Shenzhen, China based Reputed electronics and semiconductor manufacturing company. Which mainly works in, wireless communications  and, IoT domains.
